# Power BI Beginner Projects 🚀

Welcome to my Power BI beginner learning repository!

## 📌 About
This repo contains my initial journey into Power BI, where I explore basic dashboards, visualizations, and simple analytics using public datasets. It's a hands-on learning space to track my progress, experiment with visuals, and build a solid foundation in data storytelling.

## 📂 Projects

- **Amazon Sales Analysis (2025)**  
  An interactive dashboard analyzing product performance, revenue trends, and customer behavior using a Kaggle dataset.  
  📁 [Amazon_Sales_Analysis_2025.pbix](./amazon-sales-analysis-2025/Amazon_Sales_Analysis_2025.pbix)

More beginner projects coming soon...

## 🎯 Goal
To strengthen my Power BI fundamentals before moving into complex data modeling, DAX, and advanced analytics. I’ll later create a new repo for high-end, real-world projects.
